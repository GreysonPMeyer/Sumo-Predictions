# Sumo-Predictions
This project uses data science classification techniques to predict the outcome of Makuuchi sumo bouts. By leveraging historical match data, we aim to provide insights into which wrestler is most likely to win based on various features.

## Features
- **Classification Models**: Machine learning models trained to predict match outcomes.
- **Data Exploration**: Insights into sumo wrestling trends and features that influence bout outcomes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming raw data into meaningful inputs for classification.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Improve understanding of sumo match dynamics.
- Provide reliable predictions of match outcomes using machine learning models.

---

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:
- Python 3.9 or higher
- A working knowledge of pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib (or install requirements using the command below).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GreysonPMeyer/Sumo-Predictions.git

2. Navigate to the proper directort:
   cd sumo-match-outcome-predictor

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset
The dataset is sumo_data_clean.py. It consists of sumo matches from 1985 - 2019, including features such as:

Wrestler names
Ranks
Weight differences
Historical win/loss records
Data preprocessing is handled in data_preprocessing.py.
